# Mastermind

<p>This is Mastermind game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns by Ruby. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space. I Built the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors and the human player must guess them.
